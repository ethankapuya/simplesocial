# Check out [Simple Social](https://simplesocialweb.streamlit.app)!

Simple Social is a minimalistic, global social media network, allowing users to post images and videos with captions.

This project is based on FastAPI for the API framework, ImageKit for image/video storage and delivery, and the Streamlit front-end framework. The API is deployed on Render and the user-accessible web application is hosted on the Streamlit Community Cloud.
